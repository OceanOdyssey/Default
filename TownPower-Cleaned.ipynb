    "# Identifying Electric Vehicle Charging on Residential Power Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The city of Ipswich, MA uses electric meters which records usage patterns every hour in kilowatt hours (kWh).  Determine which residences are likely to be charging electric vehicles (EVs) based on usage patterns.  This data could be used to modify behavior through incentives to shift charging to off-peak times and reduce peak demand on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially 23 electric meters will be analyzed.  This could eventually be expanded up to identify EVs for the approximately 7000 residential meters.\n",
    "- The original 23 meters were chosen because some of them are known to have EVs.  These will not be revealed until after the data is summarized.  Other houses in the list do not have confirmed EVs, but they have also not been confirmed to not have an EV.\n",
    "- The data is in CSV files, where the file name is the meter number.  \n",
    "- Each CSV file has at minimum the following columns: \n",
    "    - \"Reading Date\"\n",
    "    - \"Consumption (kWh)\"\n",
    "- Houses with solar panels will also have:\n",
    "    - \"Energy Received (kWh)\"\n",
    "- Note: Meter IDs have been modified for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The accompanying PowerPoint slides discuss the trigger criteria, but the following key indicators were determined:\n",
    "    - Count of usage which is 4.5 kWh higher than the average usage 2 hours prior and 2 hours after each record examined.\n",
    "        - This is likely to count a high power (24 amp, 5.7 kW) EV charger while ignoring things like electric stoves, ovens, and dryers.\n",
    "    - Count of usage which is at least 20 kWh over 5 hours.\n",
    "        - This will catch lower power chargers based on a large usage over a long duration.\n",
    "    - Total-off peak (between 12am and 7am)\n",
    "        - This is intended to identity users with high overnight charging as a catch all for everything else when there is less noise in the data.  High ranking houses in this category which are not in the other two categories may be considered as potential EV houses.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on 2019 rather than 2020: Due to pandemic, EVs may not charge regularly if owner is working from home.\n",
    "- Ignore summer months: Air conditioning will skew results\n",
    "- Ignore winter months: Electric heat and heat pumps may skew results\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, data will summarize April, May, September, and October of 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that there will be:\n",
    "- False positives caused by other high energy uses\n",
    "- False negatives caused by short duration charging, an EV with a low capacity battery (example plug in hybrids), using work or other chargers, or a low power charger.\n",
    "- The intent is to try to be more inclusive with the final summary since suspected EV houses can be confirmed once the filtered list of houses is generated.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After summarizing and reviewing data as well as adding in the known EVs, the data was color coded by an apparent drop off in the number of triggers.  While this part is open to interpretation, the idea was to look for a clear drop-off which could be adjusted if necessary, to control how many false positives were acceptable.\n",
    "The initial criteria are:\n",
    "- 6x or higher 1 hour triggers\n",
    "- 6x or higher 5 hour triggers\n",
    "- 500 kWh total usage & at least 4 kWh Max Peak during off-peak hours\n",
    "\n",
    "If a house has at least 2 of the above criteria it is consider a high probability EV house.\n",
    "If it only has 1 of the criteria it is considered a low probability EV house.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Below is the summary table after manipulating in Excel to add extra information and to color code\n",
    "<img src=\"Town Data Final Summary-No Yearly Summary.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above criteria the final tally is below.  Keep in mind that the criteria could be adjusted after knowing which houses have an EV.  The idea is there is likely always going to be some false positives and false negatives, but the criteria must be selected to minimize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 12 houses were categorized as to not have an EV\n",
    "- 5 houses were categorized to have an EV and have a confirmed EV.\n",
    "- 4 houses were false positives, however upon visual inspection all 4 off them had some EV charging qualities, so they are considered good false positives to include in the count since they may turn out to have EVs.\n",
    "- 2 houses with false negatives, however upon visual inspection both of these did not show EV charging qualities.  These owners may have an EV with a small battery or utilize off site charging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall this trial run of the data was deemed successful and is ready to expand to a much larger dataset to identify EV owners and reach out to them for potential rate plan incentives to get them to not charge during periods of peak usage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvements:\n",
    "- The color coding of high and medium probability was done by hand since it was unclear what a good cutoff point would be.  On a larger dataset the rules should be programed in to automatically identify each group based on their \"trigger count\".\n",
    "- Have a larger dataset of confirmed houses with and without EVs.  Where not all the houses had this information confirmed, it was difficult to make rules based on assumptions.\n",
